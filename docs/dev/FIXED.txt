WHAT WAS FIXED:

1. ✅ BATCH SCRAPING - scrape_batch.sh created
   - 16 batch types (fintech, quant, ai, bigtech, etc.)
   - Usage: ./scrape_batch.sh [batch_type]
   - Much faster than scraping all 187 companies

2. ✅ FRONTEND CATEGORY TABS - Updated
   - Added: Software Eng, Backend, Frontend, Full-Stack, Mobile, DevOps
   - All 11 categories now available in UI

3. ✅ API WORKING - localhost:8000
   - docker-compose up -d api
   - open http://localhost:8000

4. ✅ SEARCH FUNCTION - Already working correctly
   - Filters by company name, title, location
   - Code in frontend/app.js lines 229-237

QUICK START:
./scrape_batch.sh ai        # Test with AI companies (fast)
docker-compose up -d api    # Start UI
open http://localhost:8000  # View dashboard
