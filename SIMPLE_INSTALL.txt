           JOB TRACKER - SIMPLE INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR YASH
================================================================================

YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED:
========================

Q: Do I need to download PostgreSQL and Redis?
A: NO! Docker includes them. Only install Docker Desktop.

Q: What about Slack?
A: NOT NEEDED! You'll use email (yashlad727@gmail.com). No paid subscription needed.

Q: What about my email password (Y@$hL@d276)?
A: You need a special "App Password" from Gmail (I'll show you how below).


WHAT TO INSTALL:
================

1. Docker Desktop ONLY
   Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   
   After installing, you'll see a whale icon in your Mac menu bar.
   That's it! PostgreSQL and Redis are included automatically.


SETUP STEPS:
============

STEP 1: Get Gmail App Password
-------------------------------
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Gmail won't accept your regular password for apps!

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Turn on "2-Step Verification" (if not already on)
3. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Choose "Mail" and "Mac"
5. Click "Generate"
6. Copy the 16-character password (looks like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop)
   👆 THIS is what you'll use, NOT Y@$hL@d276


STEP 2: Create .env file
-------------------------
cd /Users/yashlad/Development/linkedin_job_scrapper
cp .env.example .env


STEP 3: Edit .env file
----------------------
Open .env and change these lines:

SMTP_USER=yashlad727@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-16-char-app-password-here    👈 Paste the app password from Step 1
SMTP_FROM=yashlad727@gmail.com
SMTP_TO=yashlad727@gmail.com
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=                          👈 Leave this empty


STEP 4: Start Docker
---------------------
Make sure Docker Desktop is running (whale icon in menu bar), then:

docker-compose up -d

Wait 5-10 minutes for first-time setup.


STEP 5: Test It
---------------
docker-compose run --rm worker python -m src.ingest.runner --company Citadel

Check your email! You should receive notifications about any Summer 2026 jobs found.


WHAT HAPPENS NOW:
=================

✅ Tracker runs EVERY HOUR automatically
✅ Checks: Citadel, Two Sigma, Jane Street, HRT, D.E. Shaw, Microsoft, Google
✅ Looks for: Summer 2026 internships in ML/AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science
✅ Emails you: yashlad727@gmail.com with new job postings


USEFUL COMMANDS:
================

See what's happening:
    docker-compose logs -f worker

Stop the tracker:
    docker-compose down

Restart the tracker:
    docker-compose up -d

Test without email (just see results):
    docker-compose run --rm worker python -m src.ingest.runner --dry-run


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Problem: Not getting emails
Solution: 
  1. Make sure you used APP PASSWORD (not Y@$hL@d276)
  2. Check spam folder
  3. Check logs: docker-compose logs worker

Problem: Docker command not found
Solution: Install Docker Desktop from link above

Problem: No jobs found
Solution: This is normal! Means no new Summer 2026 internships posted yet.


FILES YOU NEED:
===============

✅ requirements.txt - Already created! (in case you want to run without Docker)
✅ .env - You create this from .env.example
✅ docker-compose.yml - Already created!


ALTERNATIVE (NO DOCKER):
========================

If you don't want to use Docker:

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run in terminal (no database, just shows results):
   python -m src.ingest.runner --dry-run --company Citadel

This shows results in terminal without saving to database or sending emails.


SUMMARY:
========

1. Install Docker Desktop only (includes PostgreSQL & Redis)
2. Get Gmail App Password (not your regular password!)
3. Create .env file with your app password
4. Run: docker-compose up -d
5. Get emails every hour with new Summer 2026 internships!
