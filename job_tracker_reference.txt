# Personalized LinkedIn Job Tracker - Project Reference Guide

## Overview
This project tracks **internship and job openings** relevant to your interests (Machine Learning, AI, Cybersecurity, Data Engineering, etc.) from official **company career pages and ATS APIs** (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, SmartRecruiters, etc.).  
It notifies you via email, Slack, or desktop popup whenever a new opportunity appears.

## 1. Architecture Summary

**Goal:** Detect new job postings automatically and alert you in real-time.

**Main components:**
- **Ingestion Layer:** Scrapers for each ATS/career site
- **Normalizer:** Converts all job data to a unified schema
- **Filter Engine:** Keeps only relevant postings (intern, Summer 2026, ML/AI/etc.)
- **Deduper:** Detects new or updated jobs
- **Notifier:** Sends alerts through your preferred channels
- **UI/CLI:** Manage your watchlist and filters

## 4. Configuration

### `watchlist.yaml`
Defines which companies and roles to monitor.

```yaml
targets:
  - company: "Citadel"
    ats_type: "greenhouse"
    roles_include: ["intern","summer 2026"]
    locations: ["New York","Chicago","Boston","Remote"]

  - company: "Two Sigma"
    ats_type: "lever"
    roles_include: ["intern","summer 2026"]
    locations: ["New York","Remote"]
```

### `filters.yaml`
Defines keywords and categories (ML/AI, Data, Cybersecurity).

```yaml
categories:
  ml_ai:
    title_any:
      - "(?i)machine learning"
      - "(?i)ai|artificial intelligence"
  cybersecurity:
    title_any:
      - "(?i)security|threat|incident response"
  data_engineering:
    title_any:
      - "(?i)data engineer|etl|pipeline"
  data_science:
    title_any:
      - "(?i)data scientist|applied scientist"
```

## 5. Running the Tracker

### Option A: Quick Local Run
```bash
python src/ingest/runner.py
```
Runs all scrapers once and prints matched jobs.

### Option B: Automated (via Scheduler)
```bash
docker-compose up
```
This runs the tracker every hour and sends alerts.

### Option C: Periodic via Cron
```bash
@hourly /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/job-tracker/src/ingest/runner.py
```

---

## 6. Adding New Companies

1. Identify their ATS type (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.).  
2. Add an entry to `watchlist.yaml`.  
3. The corresponding scraper will fetch data automatically.

Example:
```yaml
- company: "CrowdStrike"
  ats_type: "workday"
  roles_include: ["intern","security","ml","data"]
  locations: ["Remote","Austin","Boston"]
```

---

## 7. Notifications Setup

### Slack
Create a Slack Incoming Webhook and add it to `.env`:
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXX
```

### Email (optional)
```
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_USER=you@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=app_password
```

### Desktop Push (optional)
Use Pushover or ntfy.sh with their API URLs.

---

## 8. Customization

- Modify `filters.yaml` to adjust keywords or categories.
- Edit `watchlist.yaml` to add or remove companies.
- Update scheduler interval in `scheduler/tasks.py`.
- Change database or notification settings in `.env`.

---

## 9. Notes and Best Practices

- **Do not scrape LinkedIn directly.** It violates LinkedIn’s ToS.
- Use official **ATS JSON endpoints** instead.
- Respect **robots.txt** and use reasonable scraping intervals.
- Test new scrapers before production with sample responses.
- Maintain logs for debugging and rate-limit failures.

---

## 10. Future Enhancements

- Add NLP-based similarity scoring for fuzzy job titles.  
- Integrate with Notion or Google Sheets.  
- Build a small web dashboard (React + FastAPI).  
- Add sentiment detection for company culture using scraped reviews.
